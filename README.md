# Android App

The files/classes should have the following functionality:

- MainActivity currently handles login callback
- FragHostActivity hosts fragments containing our various functionalities
- PickEvntFragment is used for the 'pick an event for me use case'
- BrowseFragment is used for browsing and searching for events
- ChatFragment is used to display a list of active chats for the user
- PlansFragment will be used to display plans (need to change from OtherFragment)
- ProfileFragment is used to display user information and logout if they want

Currently, the following need to be implemented:

- ~Login callback to open FragHostActivity~
- Access token logic
- Log out callback and start MainActivity again
- All client-server functionality and UI for pick event
- All client-server functionality and UI for browse
- All client-server functionality and UI for chats
- All client-server functionality and UI for plans
- All client-server functionality and UI for user profile and settings
-

TBA. Testing the submodule push.
